# DDoSAttackDetectionSystem

Problem statement: Create a platform that can detect DDoS attacks

Brief Description: Distributed Denial of Service attack (DDoS) is the most dangerous
attack in the field of network security. DDoS attack halts normal functionality of critical
services of various online applications. Systems under DDoS attacks remain busy with false
requests (Bots) rather than providing services to legitimate users. These attacks are
increasing day by day and have become more and more sophisticated. So, it has become
difficult to detect these attacks and secure online services from these attacks.
